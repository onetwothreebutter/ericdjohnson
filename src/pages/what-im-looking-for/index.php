        <p class="site__paragraph-text">
            I'm happiest and most productive when I'm working on user-facing interfaces or trying to improve a design
            for the user. I get dispirited when I see content or functionality on our websites that I know is not as user-friendly
            as it could be. I want a workplace where everyone understands how easy it is to get out of sync with the user's
            needs, and is careful to think about everything in the user's frame of reference.

        <p class="site__paragraph-text">Brainstorming ideas makes me happy.
            But sharing ideas is often difficult; everyone is busy, or interpersonal and
            hierarchical dynamics inhibit idea sharing. Basic human traits like aversion to the
            new and different result in a "shoot-down" response. I want a workplace where everyone is
            brainstorming like mad and invigorated by new ideas.

        <p class="site__paragraph-text">
            It feels great when I train regularly and keep improving my skills. Working with people who are better or
            different than I am is a great way to keep learning. And a lot of learning happens through
            teaching too, so I'd like to mentor newer developers as well. I want a workplace that recognizes
            all these things and fosters them.

        <p class="site__paragraph-text">
            I care a lot about helping move society forward. I spend a decent chunk of my personal life volunteering for
            civic and environmental matters, like climate change and local zoning.
            I'd like to work on something that feels important to me like those issues do.
