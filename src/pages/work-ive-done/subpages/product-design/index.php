        <p class="site__paragraph-text">My experience in product design is limited, but I think I have a talent
            for creating novel solutions to problems.
            I participated in a local <a class="site__paragraph-link" href="https://startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">StartUp Weekend</a>,
            and my product idea&mdash;Remember When&mdash;won

            Also, I've come up with a couple of interesting product ideas in the course of my current job. I detail one

        <h2 class="site__section-heading">Remember When</h2>
        <p class="site__paragraph-text">My grandmother passed away in 2015. I had always told myself I'd spend
            more time with her, to hear more of her family stories, but I didn't spend as much time with her as I would have liked.
            And like a lot of people, she wasn't forthcoming with stories and didn't like to draw too much attention to
            herself.</p>

        <p class="site__paragraph-text">
            I participated in a Startup Weekend in 2016 and pitched an idea for an app to help elderly people tell
            their stories. My team and I visited a nursing home, where we witnessed stories pour
            out of residents when looking through family photo albums.
        </p>
        <p class="site__paragraph-text">Based on that experience, we designed an app concept that was ostensibly a digital
            photo album on a smartphone or tablet,
            but would record any audio spoken during the viewing of each photo. Later, a person fulfilling the role of
            family story curator would review
            the audio clips and save any that contained stories worth keeping.
        </p>
        <p class="site__paragraph-text">
            The app solved the problem of people feeling self-conscious when obviously being recorded.  And secondly, by
            automatically associating audio captions with the photos, it saved a huge amount of time for the family historian.
        </p>
        <p class="site__paragraph-text">
            This was our mockup:

        </figure>

        <p class="site__paragraph-text">
            At the end of Startup Weekend, our idea and pitch won us admission to Venture School at the University of
            Iowa Pappajohn Business School. Venture School is
            a six-week course that helps students learn how to evaluate business ideas to
            see if they are feasible. The main focus of the course is getting feedback from mentors and conducting
            user research by doing in-person interviews.

        <p class="site__paragraph-text">
            My team and I conducted over 70 interviews,
            interviewing people at the local shopping mall about their desires
            and experiences capturing and recording family memories. It was clear we had found something that people
            were interested in and struggled with.

        <p class="site__paragraph-text">When my company announced its annual hackathon, I drew upon my experiences with
            unproductive and inefficient meetings, to create a wireframe of an
            app that improves the quality and efficiency of meetings.</p>

        <p class="site__paragraph-text">
            Below is my video pitch of the idea that I submitted to my company's hackathon committee.
