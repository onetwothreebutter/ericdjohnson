            <a class="site__paragraph-link" href="https://runforvictimsofclimatechange.org" target="_blank"> charity run/walk</a>
            that I organized in April 2017.
            I tried to design the logo so that it was clear what the race participants were raising money for. I also tried to keep the
            level of detail down so it would work well on a t-shirt.</p>

        <p class="site__paragraph-text">
            Iowa has a famous "Iowa Native" sticker. My wife is from Illinois but considers herself an Iowan now, so I
            designed this
            sticker for her. I've put it up for sale online and at a few local shops, and it's been pretty popular in the area.

        <p class="site__paragraph-text">
            I love baseball, and I also love reading. I wanted to create a sticker that would help celebrate reading as
            much as people celebrate sports.
            The design was noticed by <a class="site__paragraph-link" href="http://www.signals.com/" target="_blank">Signals catalog</a>,
            and I licensed the design to them for a year. It's also available online and in local shops.

        <p class="site__paragraph-text">
            Due to my involvement in the local t-shirt scene and my wife's involvement in the Iowa City literary community,
            I was asked to do the t-shirts for the 2011 Iowa City Book Festival t-shirts. Below is the design I created using the
            festival's logo.
